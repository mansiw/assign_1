Datasets:

The two datasets chosen were Swiss Fertility and Socio-economic indicators (1888) Data from the built-in R datasets and Worldwide Alcohol Consumption (by country) data from fivethirtyeight. The first dataset gives us fertility and socio-economic indicator for 47 French speaking provinces of Switzerland. The second dataset provides information about the consumption of alcohol of various kinds per person in a given country. 



Analysis:

Swiss Fertility and Socio-economic indicators (1888) Data

The variables of the dataset were explored. There appeared to be an interesting relationship between fertility indicator and the percentage of catholic population in the provinces which was explored in depth. A factor variable was created to contain the levels of catholic population in a province - the three levels were 0 to 30% of the population, 30 to 70 % and 70 to 100%. The boxplot explores the state of fertility in these three categories of provinces. This is followed up with a Pearson's correlation test and a bivariate regression that is shown in the graph along with a confidence interval.



Worldwide Alcohol Consumption (by country) data

The data was explored and general statistics were outlined that showed the average consumption per person worldwide for the three kinds of alcohol - beer, wine and spirits. The average and highest consumption of all kinds of alcohol overall across all countries was also provided. Maximum consumption per person per year was also highlighted for each of these three as well as for overall alcohol.  statistics. Since there are 193 countries in the dataset, the top 10 consumer countries of each of the three kinds of alcohol were visualised to gain a better idea about the trends.
